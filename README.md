# health-management-project
Health management system project for fundamental of programming I course group project

### Simplified Project Scope
1. Patient Management:
   - Store and display basic patient information (name, ID, age, and medical history summary).
   - Only implement viewing and adding patient records.
   
2. Appointment Scheduling:
   - Allow simple appointment booking and cancellation.
   - Use a static array for appointment slots (e.g., 10 slots/day).

3. User Authentication:
   - Implement a basic login system with hardcoded usernames and passwords.

4. Staff Management (Demo):
   - Only manage staff attendance (present/absent status).
   - Store a list of staff names and mark attendance.

### Reclassified Tasks

#### Member 1: Patient Management (Data Entry and Display)
- store patient details (name, ID, age, medical history).
- Write a function to add a new patient.
- Write a function to display all patients' information.
- Use a static array to store patient records (limit: 20 patients).

---

#### Member 2: Appointment Scheduling (Static Slots)
- Use a static array to represent appointment slots (e.g., char slots[10][30] for 10 slots with patient names).
- Write a function to:
  - Book an appointment by entering patient name and slot number.
  - Cancel an appointment by clearing the slot.
- Display all appointment slots and their status (booked or available).

---

#### Member 3: User Authentication (Hardcoded Login)
- Create two hardcoded users with usernames and passwords.
- Write a login function:
  - Ask for username and password using string input.
  - Validate credentials with a simple if statement.
- Display a success or failure message based on login.

---

#### Member 4: Staff Attendance (Basic Tracking)
- Create a static array to store staff names and their attendance status.
- Write functions to:
  - Mark attendance as present or absent for a specific staff member.
  - Display the attendance status of all staff.
- Use a loop to update and display attendance.

---

#### Member 5: System Integration and Menu
- Create a menu-driven program using switch or if statements.
- Integrate:
  - Patient management functions.
  - Appointment scheduling functions.
  - User authentication and staff attendance functions.
- Ensure the menu loops until the user chooses to exit.

---

#### Member 6: Testing and Debugging
- Test each module individually to ensure correct functionality:
  - Patient management.
  - Appointment scheduling.
  - User authentication.
  - Staff attendance.
- Test the integrated system for smooth navigation and transitions.
- Handle basic edge cases like:
  - Invalid slot numbers.
  - Attempting to book a full appointment slot.

---

### Key Simplifications
1. No dynamic memory allocationâ€”static arrays only.
2. Hardcoded data for user authentication.
3. Limited features for patient management and staff attendance.
4. No complex analytics or performance evaluations.
